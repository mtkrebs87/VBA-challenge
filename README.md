# VBA-challenge


I ran into a number of difficulties with this challenge, but in the end I think that I came out ahead and learned a lot. However, I was still unsuccessful in printing the ticker values for the                   greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest volumes for the values of the stocks.

Another issue I ran into involved the time it took for the macro to run. I eventually deciding upon using a line of code to disable calculations until the macros finished a sheet - which sped up the             macro immensely.
